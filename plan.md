## Plans

To do:  
1. Add headers to the basic functionality section.  
1. Create egg group and evolution function.  
1. Create final wrapper function for rest of them.  
1. Begin EDA (see below), once all functions are completed this should
go pretty quickly.  
1. Create blog post and submit!

Functions:  
1. Base Stats  
1. Size  
1. PokeDex nums  
1. Egg Groups

EDA:  
1. Combine stats and size  
1. Create BMI variable and at least one other that is TBD.  
1. Contingency table(s) on encounters, and egg groups.  
1. Create quantitative summaries on size, stats, both or other.

Plots:  
1. Four scatter plots on Stats \~ BMI  
1. One Box Plot for individual stats  
1. Histogram BMI (maybe make groups i.e max(BMI)-5 = large,etc)  
1. Find something to make bar plot with?
